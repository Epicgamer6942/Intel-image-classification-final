# Intel-image-classification-final
Hello there, Im Jxde and Ive been coding on python as a hobby for the past 4 years. I have never used github properly however, seeing as ill need a job sooner or later, im going to start documenting my work here on github.
Recently, I have become madly in love with machine learning, and am actively trying to learn it as I go along. This is my first ever machine learning project that I have made. If there are any suggestions please let me know
I shall be happy to look at them. This project was heavily inspired by a user on Kaggle who had prepared a python notebook for a dataset called- "Intel Image classification".
